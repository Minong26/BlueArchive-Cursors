Cursors made to complement the design tones of the smartphone game [`Blue Archive`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive), as well as other official sources connected to it.

As you can see from the version number - this is an early release; probably will have to rework some of them from the ground up when time comes.

### Installation
* Right click the `Install.inf` file and choose `Install` option in the context menu;
* Choose the cursor set in the Windows cursor settings.

#### Credits
* [《蔚蓝档案》手游官方网站-与你的日常，就是奇迹](https://bluearchive-cn.com) - official Chinese site of the game for the idea, and cursor design tones that became the base for this set.
* [Cursor Installer Wizard](https://github.com/iamtalhaasghar/windows-mouse-cursor-installer-wizard) - installation file was created using this software.
