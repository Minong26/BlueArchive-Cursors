### Regular Edition
Cursors made to complement the design tones of the smartphone game [`Blue Archive`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive), as well as other official sources connected to it.

As you can see from the version number - this is an early release; probably will have to rework some of them from the ground up when time comes.
